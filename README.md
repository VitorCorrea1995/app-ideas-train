# AppIdeasTrain

I'm coding some apps to train.
Starting small, just by using plain javascript, css and html.
But later I will improve that and start to use some frameworks like Angular in frontend and Express in backend. I plain to do it when bigger apps to create comes.

I'm following the list at https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas :-)

Hope you enjoy! :-P
